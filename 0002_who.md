Right now, our team consists of four volunteers from the greater Stuttgart area.

## Project Lead
Thomas teaches Printing at [HdM](https://hdm-stuttgart.de), Burkhard teaches
Design at the same institution. They hope to be back to their regular work
rather sooner than later.

## Tech Support
Hadez and Dave met Thomas via the [CCCS](https://cccs.de) and
[shack](https://shackspace.de) and now lend a hand regarding this project's
technical setup. They'd both prefer to go to the Winchester, have a pint and
wait for this whole thing to blow over.
