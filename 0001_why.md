Professional face masks are a scarce resource at the moment and should be
reserved for health care professionals. Currently, companies world-wide are
evaluating their possibilities or starting to produce. However, demand for masks
is still going to be enormous.

We believe that face masks that protect the bystanders, last for the duration of
shopping in the market, the morning commute to work, the time spent waiting in a
queue will be required as a tool to lower infection rates and enable economy and
society.

Such masks or parts thereof can be produced efficiently using the tools present
in print shops and folding box industries. 

Die cutters and rotary die cutter tooling in presses may process hundreds of
square meters of cardboard or plastic per hour. Print shops, large and small,
are located all around the world, but those kinds of products are a novelty to
most of them. Hence the need for a platform to exchange designs, tips and
tricks.
