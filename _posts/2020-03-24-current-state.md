# Where are we at?

I, Thomas,  am sitting in my home office in Stuttgart, Germany, trying to kick
start this project, writing this page. One of my colleagues, Burkhard, is
trying to motivate students to come up with first designs. The website's there,
github might serve as a platform. Lots of items on the list to check, though. 

__If you want to help, [please write an
email](mailto:info@diecutfacemasks.org)__

We need:

- Designers to work on the Reference implementations.
- Github ninjas to teach and help manage
- Printers and Folding box manufacturers of course
- Mask builders and experts to help assessing the designs
