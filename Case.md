# The case for this project

Professional face masks are a scarce resource at the moment and should be allocated to the care professionals. Currently, companies world-around are evaluating their possibilities or starting to produce. However, demand for masks is still going to be enormous.

We beleive that face masks that protect the bystanders, last for the duration of shopping in the market, the morning commute to work, the time spent waiting in a queue will be required as a tool to lower infection rates and enable economy and society.

SUch masks or prts thereof can be produced efficiently using the tools present in print shops and folding box industries. 

Die cutters and rotary die cutter tooling in presses may process hundreds of square meters of cardboard or plastic per hour. Print shops, large and small, are located all around the world, but those kinds of products are a novelty to most of them. Hence the need for a platform to exchange designs, tips and tricks.
