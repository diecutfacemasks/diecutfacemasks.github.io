title: "Let's die cut face masks"
---


In this exceptional situation, people aroud the world struggle to break the COVID-19 infection chains.

Wearing a face mask when going out to the public is one of the key measures to lower the risk of infecting others.

So why don't we all just get one?

- Not all face masks are made to protect others.
- For those that are, the supply is too low.
- They don't last long, and [after use, the need to be disposed of safely](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/masks/masks-6.png).

People around the world have started to fabricate face masks using all sorts of creative ways [3D-Printers](https://www.opensourcemask.com/en/)
or [sewing machines](https://www.craftpassion.com/face-mask-sewing-pattern/)

# The case for this project

Professional face masks are a scarce resource at the moment and should be allocated to the care professionals. 

Damp masks might lose their ability to protect, and they make breathing harder. So, if you sew some, make a lot. 

Producing flat products on slow 3D printers is yet another issue. It takes longer to produce the mask than the mask should last. At least, you neet to factor in the change of filter, disinfecting the mask to get it back to usable state. Most importantly: the printer might be needed for other, mor precious parts.

We beleive that face masks that protect the bystanders, last for the duration of shopping in the supermarket, the morning commute to work, can be made efficiently using the tools present in print shops and folding box industries. Die cutters and rotary die cutter tooling in presses may process hundreds of square meters of cardboard in an hour. Print shops, large and small, are located all around the world,


# What's missing?

1. Reference Designs
1. Tricks, hints for Production
1. **A Platform** to share the Knowledge, Review and Feedback.


# Where are we at?

_2020-03-22 - 19:00_ 

I, Thomas,  am sitting in my home office in Stuttgart, Germany, trying to kick start this project, writing this page. One of my colleagues, Burkhard, is trying to motivate students to come up with first designs. The website's there, github might serve as a platform. Lots of items on the list to check, though. 

__If you want to help, [please write an email](mailto:info@diecutfacemasks.org)__

We need:

- Designers to work on the Reference implementations.
- Github ninjas to teach and help manage
- Printers and Folding box manufacturers of course
- Mask builders and experts to help assessing the designs
 



P.S.
_who we are:_
Currently, only two: Thomas and Burkhard.

We teach design (Burkhard) and printing (Thomas) and hope to be back to teaching at [HdM](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/) soon. No clue how this is going to be like, but we're looking forward to it.
