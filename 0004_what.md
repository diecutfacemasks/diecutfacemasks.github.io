In this exceptional situation, people aroud the world struggle to break the
COVID-19 infection chains.

Wearing a face mask when going out to the public is one of the key measures to
lower the risk of infecting others.

So why don't we all just get one?

- Not all face masks are made to protect others.

- They don't last long, and [after use, the need to be disposed of safely](https://www.who.int/images/default-source/health-topics/coronavirus/masks/masks-6.png).

People around the world have started to fabricate face masks using all sorts of creative ways [3D-Printers](https://www.opensourcemask.com/en/)
or [sewing machines](https://www.craftpassion.com/face-mask-sewing-pattern/)
